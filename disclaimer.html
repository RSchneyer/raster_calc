    <h1>DISCLAIMER</h1>
    <div>
        <p>
           I am not responsible for any bugs in this program that cause you to lose points on an assignment. 
           Math is not my strong suit, if you get a number that feels off from this site, double check it with an actual calculator.
        </p>
        <p>
           This site is also like my 4th or 5th priority this semester, so if a fix needs to be made,
           you're welcome to make an <a href="https://github.com/RSchneyer/raster_calc/issues/new">issue</a> or <a href="https://github.com/RSchneyer/raster_calc/compare">PR</a>, and I'll try to get to it.
           If you really really need to contact me, ping me in the #alumni channel of this semester's Discord server. If you're especially desperate, my Discord handle is reid#3070.
        </p>

            Finally, while I know there's not any license for this project (whoops), I'm sure Zambreno and your classmates would appreciate any features you add to this project, so please fork it and make a PR.
            Or don't, I can't stop you. I will say that I will not accept any major CSS overhauls, since I feel like that violates the original vision for this site. (if there's accessibility/QOL issues, that's a different thing)
