# Steffen's Rasterization Method Calculator

Simple little calculator thingy for triangle rasterization using [Steffen's Rasterization Method](https://github.com/RSchneyer/raster_calc/blob/main/steffens_rasterization_method.pdf). 

I made this for ISU CPRE 480 S21 MP-2 prelab, and might add more content/features as I see fit. If you're in the class and you're actually using this calculator, feel free to submit any issues/feature requests on the [Issues](https://github.com/RSchneyer/raster_calc/issues) page
